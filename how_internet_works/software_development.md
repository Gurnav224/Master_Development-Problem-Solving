## what is development in software engineering ? 

#### in software engineering "Development" encompress the entire process of creating and
#### maintaing software from initial Planing and requirements gathering to coding , testing
#### deployment and ongoing maintinence


## Key Stages of Software Development:

**Planning:** This stage involves defining the project scope, goals, and objectives, as well as identifying the target audience and their needs

**Requirements Analysis:** This phase focuses on gathering and documenting the specific requirements of the software, including functional and non-functional requirements. 

**Design:** In this stage, the software architecture, user interface, and database structure are designed

**Coding/Implementation:** This is where the actual software is written using programming languages and frameworks

**Testing:** This phase involves thoroughly testing the software to identify and fix bugs and ensure it meets the specified requirements

**Deployment:** The software is deployed to the target environment, whether it's a web server, mobile device, or other platform

**Maintenance:** This involves ongoing support, bug fixes, and enhancements to ensure the software continues to function correctly and meet evolving user needs
